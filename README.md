A simple, interactive event program guide, based on 100% HTML5 and JavaScriptâ€”the data is stored client-side, using [local storage](http://caniuse.com/#feat=namevalue-storage).

Soon, there will be templates so that you can add your own event via GitHub pull requests. For now, [EDF 2013](http://2013.data-forum.eu/ "Welcome to the European Data Forum 2013 | European Data Forum") is the one and only event deployed.
